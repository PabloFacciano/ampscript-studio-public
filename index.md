## How this app works

The execution of AMPScript or ServerSide Javascript must be done in SFMC. For this there are several ways:

- Run a Script Activity in Automation Studio.
- Send or preview an Email.
- Open a published Cloudpage.

This application uses the last option to execute the code remotely, using the result of a cloudpage as if it were an API. Email preview is planned for a new version of this application.

### First Installation

6. Open [AMPScript Studio](https://ampscript.netlify.app/).
7. Login if necesary. Go to [Settings](https://ampscript.netlify.app/#settings) > Marketing Cloud.
8. Add a new Workspace:
    - Set a name
    - Paste the URL
9. Click Save and you are ready to try the Code Editor now!
